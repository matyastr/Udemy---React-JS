                <p>I travelled with my wife and friends to Maui in May of 2019. It was one of the most 
                    amazing trips ever! My highlight was the road to Hana, a day-long trip around the eastern half
                    of the island. We stopped at some amazing waterfalls to swim!

                <p>I travelled with my fiance (then) to Alaska in May of 2018. Seeing the glaciers and light all evening were unforgettable!

                <p>Disney cruises are some of my favorite vacations. The relaxation you get and level of service can't be matched!

                <p>Being able to stay with a family in rural India shed light on a once-in-a-liftime experience. I will never forget the smell of tea from the plantations and the taste of the homecook meals.

                <p>In May 2017, I travelled for 2 weeks in Italy to study Lean Six Sigma. While not in class, I travelled a lot. I went to Verona, 
                    Venice, Rome, Florence, and Pompeii. The ruins of Pompeii were chilling and incredible to see.

                <p>In my second trip to Europe, I got the opportunity to visit Germany and the city of Munich. The highlights of this trip included a stop at the original
                    Hofbrauhaus, the Olympic Park, and the incredible food! I also had the opportunity to visit the Dachau concentration camp. It was another chilling and humble moment.

                <p>In 2016 I went on a camping trip to the Great Smokey Mountains. It was such a nice trip. The sunrises and scenery were beauituful. I also walked 10 miles on the Appalachian Trial and went to a great overlook called Charled Bunion
